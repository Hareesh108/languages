# Go Hello World

This is a simple Go program that prints **Hello, World!** to the console.

```go
package main

import "fmt"

func main() {
 fmt.Println("Hello, World!")
}
```

## ▶️ How to Run

There are a few ways to run this program:

### 1. Run with Go CLI (✅ Recommended)

If you have Go installed, you can run the program using the Go command line interface.

```bash
go run main.go
```

This is the most common and recommended way if you are practicing Go as a programming language.

### 2. Build and Run

You can also build the program into a binary and then run it.

```bash
go build -o hello-world
./hello-world
```

### 3. Run in an Online Playground

If you don't want to install Go locally, you can use an online Go playground like [Replit](https://replit.com/languages/go) or [Go Playground](https://play.golang.org/).

## ✅ Recommendation

* Use **Go CLI** if you want to practice Go as a general-purpose language (server-side, CLI tools, etc.).
* Use **Online Playground** if you are just getting started and want to experiment without installing anything.
