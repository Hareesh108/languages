## ▶️ How to Run

There are a few ways to run this program:

### 1. Run with Node.js (✅ Recommended)

Node.js allows you to run JavaScript outside the browser.

```bash
node hello-word.js
```

This is the most common and recommended way if you are practicing JavaScript as a programming language.

---

### 2. Run in a Browser Console

* Open any browser (Chrome, Firefox, Edge).
* Press **F12** or **Ctrl+Shift+I** (Cmd+Option+I on Mac) to open **Developer Tools**.
* Go to the **Console** tab.
* Copy and paste the code:

```javascript
console.log("Hello, World!");
```

Press Enter and you’ll see the output.

### 3. Run Inside an HTML File

You can embed the script in an HTML file:

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
  <head>
    <title>Hello World</title>
  </head>
  <body>
    <script src="hello-word.js"></script>
  </body>
</html>
```

Open this file in a browser, and check the browser’s console (F12 → Console).

## ✅ Recommendation

* Use **Node.js** if you want to practice JavaScript as a general-purpose language (server-side, CLI tools, etc.).
* Use **Browser Console** or **HTML** if you are focusing on web development basics.
